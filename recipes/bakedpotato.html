        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 small russet potatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, plus for seasoning</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 bunch chives (about 1-ounce)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 slices bacon, cooked crispy, and crumbled, optional garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Toss the potatoes in a bowl with the oil, salt, and pepper until 
                completely coated. Place on a baking sheet and bake until fork 
                tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a small pot of water to a boil and salt it 
                generously. Fill a medium bowl with ice water. Put the chives 
                in the boiling water and cook until bright green, about 30 seconds. 
                Immediately, plunge into the ice water to set the color. Squeeze 
                all the water out of the chives and give them a rough chop. Put into 
                a blender with the sour cream. Pulse until you have a smooth green 
                sauce and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Chill until ready to 
                serve. (Or, thinly slice the chives and stir into the sour cream, 
                season with salt and pepper, to taste.)</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes lengthwise and then across. Pinch and press the sides 
                to open the potatoes. Divide the butter among the potatoes and serve 
                with the sour cream. Garnish with crumbled bacon if desired.</li>
        </ol>
