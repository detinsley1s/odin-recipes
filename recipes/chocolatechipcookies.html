        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These cookies are delicious and are a great treat for all with a sweet
           tooth. They are easy to make and you'll have a great time both while
           cooking them, and, of course, while eating them.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 
                375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking 
                sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 
                baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)</li>
            <li>Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium 
                power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool 
                slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl 
                until smooth.</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry 
                ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care 
                not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.</li>
            <li>Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet 
                hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies 
                about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft 
                in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy 
                you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack 
                to cool. Serve.</li>
            <li>Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
